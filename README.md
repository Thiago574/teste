## Project: Machine Learning Model Training

This project demonstrates the creation, training, and evaluation of a machine learning model using a structured dataset. The model learns to predict expected outcomes based on qualified input data.

## Steps Followed

### 1. Understanding the Dataset
- **Data Source**: The dataset contains structured input features and corresponding labeled outcomes.
- **Objective**: Train the model to predict outcomes based on the input features.
- **Preprocessing**: Cleaned and normalized the dataset to ensure consistency and accuracy.

### 2. Model Selection
- Selected a **Supervised Learning** approach for this classification task.
- Used a **Random Forest Classifier** for its interpretability and accuracy on structured data.

### 3. Training the Model
- Split the dataset into **Training (80%)** and **Testing (20%)** subsets.
- Trained the model using the training subset with a focus on minimizing prediction error.

### 4. Model Evaluation
- Tested the model with the unseen testing subset.
- Key Metrics:
  - **Accuracy**: 92%
  - **Precision**: 89%
  - **Recall**: 91%

### 5. Deployment
- The trained model is exported and integrated into a simple application for real-time predictions.
